## Overview

The chatbot is powered by a machine learning model trained on a set of intents. Each intent represents a category of user messages, and the model is trained to recognize these intents and provide relevant responses. The chatbot can handle greetings, goodbyes, jokes, and more.

## Features

- Recognizes user intents.
- Provides relevant responses based on user messages.
- Supports various categories of user interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the chatbot, you will need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

To use the chatbot, you can run the chat.py file. The chatbot will listen for user input and respond based on the training data.

```bash
python chat.py
```

The chatbot will provide responses to your messages based on the predefined intents and responses.

## Training the Chatbot

If you want to train the chatbot with additional intents or modify the responses, you can do so by editing the JSON data in the intents.json file. After making changes, you can run the train.py script to retrain the model.

```bash
python train.py
```
